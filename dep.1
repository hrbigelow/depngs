.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
.B dep
is a collection of programs for analyzing single-base loci, one at a
time, from an alignment of next-gen sequencing reads.

.TP
.B comp
dep comp [options] input.jpd input.pileup output.comp [output.points]

Estimates locus base composition with confidence intervals, for each
locus in the provided pileup file.  Computes confidence intervals as
base-marginal quantile values for each of the four nucleotides for the
specified quantiles.

.TP
.B dist
dep dist [options] sample_index.rdb contig_order.rdb

Estimates mutational distance at each locus and for each pair of
samples specified in \fBsample_index.rdb\fP, reporting loci that
differ by some minimum amount.  The 1-D mutational distance
distribution is generated from the two 4-D base composition estimates
run on the pair of samples by generating random pairs of sample
points, one from each 4-D distribution, and computing the euclidean
distance between each pair of points. From the 1-D distribution, it
computes confidence intervals. The same approach is taken to generate
mutational distance for indels.

The vast majority of loci will not differ between samples.  To take
advantage of this and avoid doing unnecessarily refined computations,
\fBdep dist\fP uses a two-pass strategy:

.RS
.TP
.B Test 1
Take a first-pass smaller number of sample points from each posterior,
and generate the course-grained 1D distance distribution from this.
Calculate the quantile value for the lowest specified quantile. If the
value is less than the minimum threshold, move on to next locus
without reporting any difference. Otherwise, proceed to test 2.

.TP
.B Test 2
Take a final pass, larger number of points, and proceed as in test 1.
If no above-threshold difference is detected, move on to next locus
without reporting any difference. Otherwise, report the locus as
differing, calculating all quantile values.

.RE

.TP
.B Posterior Probability Distribution used for \fIcomp\fP and \fIdist\fP.

The posterior probability distribution is a real-valued function
defined over the 4D "nucleotide composition" space of (A,C,G,T) with
A+C+G+T = 1 and all positive.  It is a function parameterized by the
set of all basecalls and associated quality scores that align at a
single locus.  Its value at a point in {A,C,G,T} represents the
relative probability that the actual sample base composition at that
locus takes that value. Because it is a continuous probability
distribution and is not analytical, it can only be used by generating
sample points and calculating quantile values by counting points.

The distribution function itself can be thought of as a 4D Dirichlet
whose alpha parameters are the actual basecalls, with the "correction"
owing to the imperfect quality scores of those basecalls.  The use of
the Dirichlet 

.TP
.B bqslocus
dep bqslocus [options] input.pileup label counts.bqs counts.bs counts.s

Tallies \fBbqslocus\fP (basecall, quality score, strand) summary
counts from provided pileup file, generating three files: bqs.cts,
bs.cts, s.cts. These are per locus statistics over (b,q,s), (b,s), or
(s).

.TP
.B bqs
dep bqs input.pileup output.bqs

Tallies \fBbqs\fP (basecall, quality score, strand) summary counts
data over the entire pileup file. This file theoretically summarizes
the characteristics of the sequencing run over all the data.

.TP
.B bqs2jpd
dep bqs2jpd input.bqs output.jpd

Expands \fBbqs\fP (basecall, quality score, strand) counts data that
is generated by \fBdep bqs\fP into bqsf (basecall, quality score,
strand, founder base).  The term \fIfounder base\fP refers to the
unseen actual nucleotide present in the single molecule that "founded"
the PCR colony on the flowcell.  Expansion means, for example, that a
basecall of "A" and quality score 30 imply that the founder base is
"A" with a probability of 99.9%, and C, G, T, each with an equal
probability of 0.033%.  This expansion is simplistic and could be
improved using more sophisticated statistics.

.TP
.B simp
dep simp FTYPE input.jpd sim_comp.rdb > output.pileup

Simulates a pileup file using FTYPE fastq quality scale (one of
.BR Sanger ,
.BR Solexa ,
.BR Illumina13 , 
or 
.BR Illumina15 ).
For each line in \fBsim_comp.rdb\fP, generates one line of pileup
output.  For each input line, the simulation first generates
a 'founder base' randomly from the composition provided in that line,
then generates basecalls and qualities according to the bayesian
causal model parameterized by the joint probability distribution in
\fBinput.jpd\fP, to the sequencing depth specified in
\fBsim_comp.rdb\fP.

.TP
.B simc
dep simc [options] basecomp_priors.rdb nsim > sim_comp.rdb

Simulates a set of \fBnsim\fP base compositions by sampling from the
distribution provided by \fBbasecomp_priors.rdb\fP.  (See format
descriptions below)

.B Example output

Below shows the base composition estimate for locus chr1:10039 for
samples 11, 12, and 13.  Five quantile values are shown, which, for
this run were the default composition quantile values of 0.005, 0.05,
0.5, 0.95, and 0.995. The lowest quantile value can be used as a
conservative lower limit to establish the presence of a given base at
the locus at high confidence.  The highest quantile value, conversely,
can be used as an upper-limit threshold to establish the absence of a
given base at high confidence.

.B output.vcf
A minimal VCF v4.1 formatted file. Since the VCF output assumes
diploidy, it is not a very good way of expressing base composition
with confidence intervals, and is not very well supported. The basic
technique is to use the mean composition estimate among posterior
sample points, and find the nearest diploid composition to that mean,
using that to represent the locus. Every locus is given a 'PASS' flag,
regardless of quality measures.

.TP
.B output.idist
Similar in concept to \fBoutput.dist\fP, but deals with differences in
the indel 'composition'. Eeach read at a particular locus can exhibit
either an insertion, a deletion, or a non-indel 'event'.  The
particular sequence and length inserted or deleted distinguishes
different indels from each other as separate 'events'.  Taking a tally
of all event types across a pair of samples, the resulting sets can be
viewed as a sampling from an underlying population of events.

This is the same conception as with mutational distance: the
underlying base composition is estimated as a sampling of events of
type 'A','C','G', or 'T'.  The main difference is that, with base
composition events, quality score is taken into account to estimate
probability that the true event corresponds with the observed one
(basecall vs actual founder base).  That is, there is no 'quality
score' associated with the probability that the alignment indel (or
non-presence of indel) is correct. In particular, many of the
differing loci tend to have poly-A stretches, indicating alignment
error.

Nonetheless, the mutational distance is calculated the same way, by
sampling from two Dirichlet distributions parameterized on the indel
event tallies, and then generating a 1-D euclidean distance
distribution, and finally generating quantiles.

.B output.points
Optional sample points and numerical CDFs output from \fBdep comp\fP.
Warning: very large file, will contain 10000 lines (or the value of
\fBfinal_num_points\fP) for each locus processed. Useful for plotting
and visualizing the shape of the posterior as a cloud of points in
3-D, or for plotting the individual base CDFs using their ranks. Also,
the lines do NOT have information in them that denotes which locus the
points are from. So, this output should be used either with
single-locus input, or else the N lines need to be split out into
groups. Tab-separated fields are:

.RS
.PD 0
.IP <i> 20
This is the i in "the i'th sample point" among the sample points taken
from the posterior. It is just an arbitrary index of the point
(zero-based)
.IP <sample_label>
sample label as specified in \fBlabel\fP flag or \fBsamples.rdb\fP
file.
.IP <a_i>
Coordinate of the i'th sample point cooresponding to base 'a'
(resp. c, g, or t)
.IP <c_i>
etc
.IP <g_i>
etc
.IP <g_i>

.B basecomp_priors.rdb
A file that describes a distribution of locus compositions to choose
from in order to simulate loci of each of those compositions.  The
tab-delimited fields are:

<fraction_A>  <fraction_C>  <fraction_G>  <fraction_T>  <fraction_this_comp>

For example:

.br
0.5    0.5    0    0   10
.br
1      0      0    0   10
.br
0      1      0    0   20

would specify a grab-bag of 25% A/C het loci, 25% A/A homozygous loci,
and 50% C homozygous loci.  The values in the last column need not be
normalized.


.TP
.B sim_comp.rdb
Simulated locus composition output.  Describes a the base composition
of a set of loci simulated according to the frequencies in
\fBbasecomp_priors.rdb\fP.  Each locus is one line with fields:

<position>  <A_comp>  <C_comp>  <G_comp>  <T_comp> <depth>

.B Command Option Definitions

Here are given the symbolic names of command options for all of these
commands, grouped by theme.  The actual one-letter switches for these
options are shown in each specific sub-command.

.B General

.RS

.TP 24
.I num_threads
Number of threads for running the program.  Uses POSIX threads, not
processes.  (There will be only one process, but the %CPU will show
roughly as i.e. 1600% for 16 threads.

.TP
.I max_mem
Approximate maximum memory in bytes to reserve for running the program
overall.  Since the input pileup files are broken into chunks that fit
into this amount of memory, using a larger amount will limit the
number of read interrupts necessary to consume the entire input.  In
practice, using more than 100 MB for typical input doesn't seem to
yield any performance improvement.

.TP
.I fastq_type
One of
.BR Sanger ,
.BR Solexa ,
.BR Illumina13 , 
or 
.BR Illumina15 .
Specify this if you know the quality score offset of the quality
scores in the pileup file. Without setting this, dep dist will
auto-detect it, but this requires scanning the entire pileup file,
which will take several minutes.

.TP
.I max_mem
option is a few orders of magnitude larger than this.

.TP
.I label
An arbitrary string to be added to each line of output.  Useful for
identifying output by line rather than by filename, so that it can be
pooled and batch processed.

.TP
.I verbose
With this flag set, output lots of information about mode-finding and
other things. This is \fBvery\fP verbose.

.RE

.B Optional Files

.RS
.TP 24
.I dist_file
Name of file to report mutational distance quantile values.  If not
provided, will not perform distance calculation.

.TP
.I comp_file
Name of file to report base composition marginal quantile values. If
not provided, do not perform composition estimates.

.TP
.I vcf_file
Name of file to report VCF-formatted output of all loci in any sample
pair that is changed.  Reports all possible single nucleotide changes.

.TP
.I indel_dist_file
Name of file to report loci that differ in indel content, using the
Dirichlet parameterized by the counts of each indel event. If not
provided, do not calculated indel distance.

.TP
.I sample_pairings_file
Input file that defines what pairs of samples to compare.  Contains
lines of <label1><tab><label2>, where <label1> and <label2> are the
labels of samples given in \fBsamples.rdb\fP file given as an
argument.

.RE

.B Thresholds and Quantiles

.RS
.TP 24
.I min_quality_score
The minimum quality score that a base must have in order to be
considered as data for parameterizing the posterior.  Set this above 2
if you feel that the true probabilities of base miscalls are too
poorly modeled by their Phred definitions.

.TP
.I dist_quantiles_file
A file with a tab-separated list of numbers between zero and one.
These specify all of the quantiles to output quantile values for the
mutational distance estimate.

.TP
.I comp_quantiles_file
A file with a tab-separated list of numbers between zero and one.
These specify all of the quantiles to output quantile values for the
single-locus base composition marginal estimates.

.TP
.I min_test_quantile_value
Minimum quantile value of \fItest_quantile\fP to report a locus in
\fIcomp_file\fP (if running \fBcomp\fP) or to report a locus in
\fIdist_file\fP (if running \fBdist\fP).

.B Parameters affecting the Metropolis-Hastings procedure

These parameters should almost certainly be left alone.  Advanced
users may want to change the numbers of sample points in case they
want the program to run faster or to get higher-resolution sampling.

.RS
.TP 24
.I tuning_num_points
Number of posterior sample points to use for tuning the Dirichlet
Proposal distribution for Metropolis Hastings sampling.

.TP
.I prelim_num_points
Number of posterior sample points to use for the first-pass
point-pairs mutational distance difference test.  This test is
performed after the modes are found and the mode difference exceeds the
.I min_test_quantile_value
threshold.

.TP
.I num_sample_point_pairs
Number of random pairs of points to generate for both the first-pass
and final mutational distance tests.

.TP
.I final_num_points
Number of posterior sample points for the final test, after the mode
difference test and first-pass point-pairs test pass.

.TP
.I test_quantile
The quantile to use with
.I prelim_num_points
points, whose value must exceed the
.I min_test_quantile_value
threshold.

.RE

.B Parameters affecting the Metropolis-Hastings internals

These parameters almost certainly should be left alone.

.RS
.TP 24
.I target_autocor_offset
Leave as default value of 6.  During tuning of the Dirichlet proposal
distribution in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a Markov Chain of
posterior evaluations is made.  A poorly fit proposal will result in a
high rejection rate and thus low autocorrelation offset.  This insists
on a minimum.

.TP
.I max_tuning_iterations
Maximum number of iterations for tuning the Dirichlet proposal
distribution. This parameter only need be increased if you are dealing
with ultra-deep sequenced data (greater than 1000x). In this case, the
Metropolis-Hastings sampling scheme may fail, and the software falls
back to a slower yet completely reliable Slice Sampling.

.TP
.I autocor_max_value
Maximum autocorrelation value.  Default 0.2.  The maximum
autocorrelation to be considered as valid for the purpose of choosing
an offset for sample point thinning.

.TP
.I gradient_tolerance
Setting this closer to zero results in the mode-finding algorithm
doing fewer iterations before it halts.  If the tolerance is too high
(too loose), the found mode may be too inaccurate.  Run dep dist with
the -V flag with successively looser tolerance (starting at 1e-20, til
1e-5 or so) and study the output to determine what is needed.

.TP
.I prior_alpha
Should range from 1e-5 to 1. Default 0.1.

.TP
.I gradient_tolerance
Setting this closer to zero results in the mode-finding algorithm
doing fewer iterations before it halts.  If the tolerance is too high
(too loose), the found mode may be too inaccurate.  Run dep dist with
the -V flag with successively looser tolerance (starting at 1e-20, til
1e-5 or so) and study the output to determine what is needed.
