The exact interpretation of the parameters of a beta distribution in
terms of number of successes and failures depends on what function is
used to extract a point estimate from the distribution. The mode of a
beta distribution is \frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha + \beta - 2}, which
corresponds to \alpha - 1 successes and \beta - 1 failures; but the
mean is \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}, which corresponds to \alpha
successes and \beta failures. The use of \alpha - 1 and \beta - 1 has
the advantage that a uniform {\rm Beta}(1,1) prior corresponds to 0
successes and 0 failures, but the use of \alpha and \beta is somewhat
more convenient mathematically and also corresponds well with the fact
that Bayesians generally prefer to use the posterior mean rather than
the posterior mode as a point estimate. The same issues apply to the
Dirichlet distribution.
