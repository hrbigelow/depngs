If you have an infinite urn with N types of balls, and some frequency
(F1, ..., FN) of each type of balls in the urn, and you draw some
number of balls, you will get a count (C1, ..., Cn) of each type of
ball.  The counts you get inform your belief in the likelihood that
the frequency (F1, ..., Fn) characterizing the urn, takes on various
values.

The Dirichlet distribution in N dimensions, parameterized by the (C1,
..., Cn) gives you this belief.

It thus may be possible to conceptualize, for a given locus, the total
number of reads covering it as 'N', and each read being a 'type', one of:

1.  a normal read (no indels at that locus)
2.  a read with a 1-base deletion at that locus
3.  a read with a 2-base deletion at that locus
...
10. a read with an 'A' insertion at that locus
11. a read with an 'AC' insertion at that locus

and so forth.

Obviously, there are a large number of types.  However, at any given
locus, we can consider only the types we observe.  The shape of a
Dirichlet of fewer dimensions is identical to that of more dimensions
whose Alpha's are zero. (prove this)

So, this suggests a way to answer the question of how different two
mixed populations are, with confidence intervals.  For the problem of
indels, we need only consider the union of all types of insertions and
deletions among the two samples at that locus, and then sample from
two Dirichlet distributions.

What would some cases be like?

The Dirichlet is at least 2-dimensional.  So, if there is only one
type among both of the situations,
