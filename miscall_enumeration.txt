The approach detailed in weight_ratio_sampling.txt failed.  Too many
loci produced weight ratios that ranged over 10^6 or more, which
suggests severe undersampling.

Unfortunately, this doesn't bode well for generating sample points
from the full Posterior, because it means we don't have a suitable
proposal distribution for it in all cases, and thus cannot sample from
it efficiently.

A new approach is described in this note.  In this new approach, the
posterior is reformulated as a weighted mixture of dirichlets.  Each
dirichlet represents the contribution to the posterior resulting from
{ nA, nC, nG, nT } counts of founder bases.  For D reads, there are
4^D possible underlying ordered sequences of actual founder bases, one
in each read.  Each sequence is weighted according to the probability
that the founder bases take on those values, based on the basecall and
quality.  For example, if the first read has basecall A at quality 30,
then a founder base of 'A' has 0.999, while any other founder base has
0.00033.
