This describes a process to be thought of as "reverse diffusion".
Ordinary diffusion happens when a drop of ink is suspended in water
and time passes.  Each molecule of ink undergoes a random walk, whose
expected displacement gets longer with time.

In the same way, the sequencing process can be thought of as a
diffusion process.  We start at a point in the 4-simplex that
represents base-composition.  All of the molecules that make up that
base composition are sequenced with some fixed error probability.  The
resulting set of basecalls implies a base composition that has
diffused away from the real one due to the error rate.

The question is, for a given error rate, how much should the base
composition to change?  It is interesting to note the asymetry.  If
the original base composition is 100% of one base and the overall base
miscall rate is 0.01, then we should expect 1/100 of the bases to be
miscalled.  The basecall composition has thus drifted from the corner
of the simplex a bit toward the center.  Likewise, if the original
composition is 90% A, 10% other, then 90% of the miscalls will be
'other', and only 10%/3 of 'other' will mutate back to 'A'.  Thus, the
basecall composition still drifts towards the center of the simplex,
but there is a small contingent that drifts back to the corner.  We
see that the fixed point, where the basecall composition is equal to
the original composition, is 0.25 of each base.

To state the problem explicitly, we start with a 2-category problem.
Suppose you have 1000 poker chips, each with a red and blue side.  An
inference game is played, the rules are as follows:

1.  The chips (stamped with a number from 1-1000) are laid out on the
table and placed with a specific side up.  e.g. it could be 1R, 2B,
3R, 4R, ..., 1000B.  This is known as a configuration h (for hidden)
since you, the player are not going to see this.

Note: There are 2^1000 possible configurations.  Each one belongs to
one of the 1000 configuration 'groups', G0, G1, G2, ..., G1000, determined
by how many chips are blue-up.

2.  The dealer now rolls a 100-sided die once for each chip.  If he
rolls a '1', he turns the chip over, otherwise he leaves the chip as
is.

3.  You now get to see the final configuration o (observed).  Let's
say it is 1R, 2R, ..., 37B, 38R, ..., 217B, ..., 1000R.  Let's say
that there are 10 blue showing.

Now, the question is, what is the probability that the original hidden
configuration belongs to G0, G1, etc?

Note, this is ill-defined at the moment.  You have not been told what
the prior probabilities of the original configurations are.  Let's
just say they are P(h) for now.


Solution:

First, let g(c) mean "the group that configuration c belongs to".  It
simply consists of counting the number of blue-up chips in the
configuration.

we would like to write the conditional probability P(o|g(h)), that is,
"the probability of the observed configuration given the group of the
hidden configuration.

Suppose g(o) = G10 and g(h) = G2.  Then P(o|g(h)) can be expressed as
three components:

Let

G2 (1000-choose-10) = 49950
S0: subset of G2 with 0 blue-up overlap with o (990-choose-2) * (10-choose-0) = 489555
S1: subset of G2 with 1 blue-up overlap with o (990-choose-1) * (10-choose-1) = 9900
S2: subset of G2 with 2 blue-up overlap with o (990-choose-0) * (10-choose-2) = 45

P(o|S0) = 489555 * prob(12 flips)
P(o|S1) = 9900 * prob(10 flips)  /* 1 BR flip, 9 RB flips */
P(o|S2) = 45 * prob(8 flips) /* 8 RB flips */


Note that P(o|h) is permutation symmetric.  For any permutation Q(),
P(Q(o)|Q(h)) = P(o|h).  This is because both terms in the formula (the
m-choose-n term and the prob(n flips) term) only concern numbers of
red and blue, and numbers of red and blue that overlap.  By permuting
both o and h in the same way, the numbers that overlap are not
changed.


Note, then that the set Gn is also invariant under permutation.  Thus:

P(o|g(h)) = P(Q(o)|g(h)) ~ P(g(o)|g(h))

Because of this, we resolve the paradox of why the particular order of
the observed chips (which ones are red and blue) doesn't affect the
probability estimate.


Now that we have P(g(o)|g(h)), we have a D x D (= 1000 x 1000) table.
But, what is P(g(h))?  In fact, this is easier to specify than P(h),
and it is more sensible.  We *could* perhaps specify P(g(h)) = 1/D
(uniform distribution).  This would then make P(g(h)|g(o)) ~
P(g(o)|g(h)), and we could do what we want.

So, what is the formula for P(g(o)|g(h))?

First, we need a function for the probability P(o|Si)


Let g(o) be number of blue-up chips in o.
Let S(h,v) be subset of all configurations in S(h) with v blue-up overlapping o.

v may vary from 0 to V = min(g(o), g(h)).


P(o|S(h,v)) = mcn(D-V,g(o) - v) * mcn(g(h), v) * prob(D, g(o) + g(h) - v)

sum_ol ( { P(o_g|S_ol) }
